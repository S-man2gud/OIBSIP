# Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data (Mc Donald's Menu)

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns. The findings aim to help retail businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and optimize their product offerings.

## Project Objectives
- Perform data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Generate descriptive statistics to understand the dataset.
- Visualize trends and relationships in the data using various plots.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the insights.

## Key Features
1. Data Cleaning:
- Checked and resolved missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
2. Descriptive Statistics:
- Computed basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for key metrics (e.g., calories, sodium, and total fat).
3. Data Visualization:
- Analyzed calorie distribution, sodium content by category, and correlations between total fat and calories using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
4. Insights and Recommendations:
Suggested practical steps like introducing low-calorie menu options, reducing sodium in recipes, and offering high-fiber items.

## Technologies Used
- Python:
  - Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail-sales-eda.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd retail-sales-eda

3. Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook retail_sales_eda.ipynb

## Data
The dataset includes information about retail sales and menu items, such as:
- Category: Food or drink category.
- Calories: Total calories per serving.
- Total Fat, Sodium, Fiber, etc.: Nutritional details for each item.
Sample rows of the dataset are available in the repository for reference.

## Visualizations
- Calorie Distribution: Histogram showing the calorie distribution across items.
- Sodium Content by Category: Bar chart comparing sodium levels by food type.
- Carbohydrate Content by Category: Bar chart comparing carbohydrate levels by food type.
- Protein Content by Category: Bar chart comparing protein levels by food type.
- Dietary fiber Content by Category: Bar chart comparing dietary fiber levels by food type.
- Calories vs. Total Fat: Scatter plot revealing the correlation between fat content and calories.

## Recommendations
- Introduce health-conscious menu options.
- Reduce portion sizes for high-calorie items.
- Add more fiber-rich ingredients to meals.
- Reformulate recipes to lower sodium levels.
- Improve customer communication with clear nutritional labeling.

## Next Steps
- Develop interactive dashboards for real-time insights.
- Expand analysis to include customer demographics and purchase behavior.
- Optimize marketing campaigns using EDA findings.
